# Progress Log

## 2025-10-15
- Hardened `server/api/prompt.ts` OpenAI handling to normalize different message payload shapes (plain text arrays, tool calls) and improved sanitization to avoid "Empty response from OpenAI" errors.
- Added temporary debug logging (guarded outside production) around payload extraction and JSON parsing in `server/api/prompt.ts` to capture raw/cleaned previews during tests.
- Escaped control characters within JSON string values in `server/api/prompt.ts` so unescaped newlines from the model no longer break JSON parsing.
- Next step: retest `/api/prompt` endpoint to confirm responses are now parsed into valid Jira JSON.

## 2025-10-16
- Extended `/api/prompt` with a sufficiency pre-check that returns `needs_info` prompts and enforces a three-round clarification cap.
- Updated shared types and `FormPrompt.vue` to carry clarification state, surface new toast messaging, and launch a follow-up modal when the model needs more data.
- Added `ModalClarificationPrompt` component and trimmed `ModalJiraTask` to display only the finalized Jira task payload.
- Next step: exercise the UI through an initial request, a clarification cycle, and the final Jira task to confirm the loop behaves as expected.
