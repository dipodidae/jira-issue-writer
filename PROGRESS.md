# Progress Log

## 2025-10-15
- Hardened `server/api/prompt.ts` OpenAI handling to normalize different message payload shapes (plain text arrays, tool calls) and improved sanitization to avoid "Empty response from OpenAI" errors.
- Added temporary debug logging (guarded outside production) around payload extraction and JSON parsing in `server/api/prompt.ts` to capture raw/cleaned previews during tests.
- Escaped control characters within JSON string values in `server/api/prompt.ts` so unescaped newlines from the model no longer break JSON parsing.
- Next step: retest `/api/prompt` endpoint to confirm responses are now parsed into valid Jira JSON.
